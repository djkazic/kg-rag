The Lightning Network utilizes Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) for secure transactions.
Uses a decentralized network of nodes to find the most efficient path for a payment.
Allows payments to pass through multiple nodes to reach the destination.
Channels are funded with Bitcoin, and the capacity is shared between parties.
The balance in a channel can be updated many times without blockchain transactions.
Either party can close a channel, settling the final state on the Bitcoin blockchain.
To prevent old commitment states from being used to steal funds, third-party services called Watchtowers monitor channels for fraud while parties are offline.
Various node implementations for the Lightning Network exist, such as LND, c-lightning, and Eclair.
LND: one of the most popular LN software implementations.
Atomic swaps allows for the exchange of different cryptocurrencies on the LN without needing a trusted third party.
Channels are limited to 483 HTLCs per direction because of the maximum transaction size for Bitcoin onchain.
